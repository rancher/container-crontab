container-crontab
========

A microservice that will perform actions on a Docker container based on cron schedule.

## Building

`make`

## Running

Standard Docker mode:

`./bin/container-crontab`

Rancher Mode:

`./bin/container-crontab --rancher-mode [--metadata-url http://rancher-metadata/latest]`

## Usage

### Standard Mode:
Once `container-crontab` is up and running it watches Docker socket events for `create, start and destroy` events.
If a container is found to have the label `cron.schedule` then it will be added to the crontab based on the schedule.

Cron scheduling rules follow: [Expression Format](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)

Use [Cron Expression Generator & Explainer](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html) to quickly generate cron expressions and convert them to readable text format.

### Rancher Mode:
When running in Rancher mode, the service watches Rancher metadata for service state. If the service is in any other mode
then Active, then the job is disabled. 

It watches metadata on a 5 second interval, so there is a small window where a job could be run when the state is changing. If
the container is stopped as part of the upgrade or service deactivate, that event will be immediate. When services are reactivated
there is a 5 second window for the job to be re-activated.

## Override labels that can be applied

To override the default start action on the container, set the label `cron.action` equal to `stop` or `restart`.

To override the default 10 second restart/stop timeout set the label `cron.restart_timeout` to the number of
seconds you would like. For instance for 20 seconds: `cron.restart_timeout=20`.

## Examples
```
# Restart every minute
> docker run -d --label=cron.schedule="0 * * * * ?" ubuntu:16.04 date
```

## Metrics

Starting in v0.3.0 the container-crontab exposes a prometheus metrics endpoint `http://<ip>:9191/metrics`.
From that you can get a guage on the number of Jobs sliced by Active/Inactive states. It also provides other
golang information about the program.
